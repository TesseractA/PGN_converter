# PGN_converter
Used for getting rid of engine nonsense in PGNs

usage: execute PGN-converter.py and it will take any PGN as input, then output a PGN witthout the extra nonsense in the PGNs. some more description in the code and options. probably not too easy to read the code, sorry, but it's commented.
