# PGN_converter
Used for getting rid of engine nonsense in CCCC (Computer chess championship) PGNs

usage: execute PGN-converter.py and it will take any PGN as input, then output a PGN witthout the extra nonsense in the PGNs. some more description in the code and options. probably not too easy to read the code, sorry, but it's commented.

example: ``./PGN-converter.py /Users/noobling/Downloads/ccc14-bullet-test.pgn``
works for UNIX operating systems.

on windows, ``py ./PGN-converter.py /Users/noobling/Downloads/ccc14-bullet-test.pgn ``
is necessary. download python 3 for windows if you don't have it already.
